# 1: "short break"
# 0: My bad my bad ðŸ˜­ it was supposed to be short but I just couldn't get myself to work on it.
# 1: Whys that?
# 0: So for context, i am on sprite rendering part, exactly where the fun part of the ppu ends, at least for me it does.
# 0: So you know, just like GB, NES also works on the principle of tile-based rendering right?
# 0: I simply don't enjoy working with it, handling each pixel and their timings correctly is such a pain in the ass. It's so messy and delicate, not fun at all.
# 0: So yeah I am hardly ever in mood of working on it.
# 1: So are you gonna finish it or no?
# 0: I will, depends on my mood really.
