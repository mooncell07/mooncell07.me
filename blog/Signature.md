# 1: Hey!
# 1: What happened to all the commits?
# 1: Why are all of them suddenly unverified now?!
# 0: I retroactively modified the email addresses of all commits and force-pushed them which caused a mismatch between signatures, resulting in all of them losing their "verified" status.
# 1: But why would you do that?
# 0: I kinda wanted to have a proper dev email setup and a consistent commit history accross projects.
# 1: There must've been some better, non destructive way?
# 0: Oh there were alternatives but to be honest, this approach seemed the cleanest.
# 0: Of course i understand how wild it is but my current situation allowed for it so I did it anyways.
# 0: I am the sole developer for all my projects since the beginning, so it doesn't really matter much.
# 0: But yeah I would never do something this crazy in a collaborative project!
# 1: You better not! Also what are its consequences? Now that all of it is unverified?
# 0: Shouldn't really matter in my opinion because from here onwards all future commits will ALWAYS be verified.
# 0: I have setup the GPG keys.
# 1: Fine i guess.
